# st-organise-photos
A TUI program using ratatui, Sixels and manual labour to name and tag family photos and videos with relevant information.

# Future of the project

Could also name it `family archiver utils`. It is intended for the end user who is the family archiver. This util is the photo organising software, maybe this can be separate to the video software.

Some other utils may include mailing software which tries to find relatives to the user using a database so that more archival can occur. There will be a man page that discusses image transfer on iOS, etcetera, as well as a comprehensive Internet guide at https://averageman282.men that discusses the usage of `family archiver utils` via WSL2 (since libimobiledevice requires a Linux env, there's no point making a port of this software except if Android phones play nicer on Windows than iOS does). Probably use fedora or opensuse under WSL2.
